// MARK: - TypePlugin Interface

/// An interface that handles the lifecycle of dynamically loaded types.
/// 
/// The GObject type system supports dynamic loading of types.
/// It goes as follows:
/// 
/// 1. The type is initially introduced (usually upon loading the module
///    the first time, or by your main application that knows what modules
///    introduces what types), like this:
///    
/// (C Language Example):
/// ```C
///    new_type_id = g_type_register_dynamic (parent_type_id,
///                                           "TypeName",
///                                           new_type_plugin,
///                                           type_flags);
///    
/// ```
///    where `new_type_plugin` is an implementation of the
///    `GTypePlugin` interface.
/// 
/// 2. The type's implementation is referenced, e.g. through
///    `g_type_class_ref()` or through `g_type_create_instance()` (this is
///    being called by `g_object_new()`) or through one of the above done on
///    a type derived from `new_type_id`.
/// 
/// 3. This causes the type system to load the type's implementation by
///    calling `g_type_plugin_use()` and `g_type_plugin_complete_type_info()`
///    on `new_type_plugin`.
/// 
/// 4. At some point the type's implementation isn't required anymore,
///    e.g. after `g_type_class_unref()` or `g_type_free_instance()` (called
///    when the reference count of an instance drops to zero).
/// 
/// 5. This causes the type system to throw away the information retrieved
///    from `g_type_plugin_complete_type_info()` and then it calls
///    `g_type_plugin_unuse()` on `new_type_plugin`.
/// 
/// 6. Things may repeat from the second step.
/// 
/// So basically, you need to implement a `GTypePlugin` type that
/// carries a use_count, once use_count goes from zero to one, you need
/// to load the implementation to successfully handle the upcoming
/// `g_type_plugin_complete_type_info()` call. Later, maybe after

/// unload the implementation again. The type system makes sure to call
/// `g_type_plugin_use()` and `g_type_plugin_complete_type_info()` again
/// when the type is needed again.
